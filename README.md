# 📌 ML_Algos_from_scratch

This repository contains classic **Machine Learning algorithms** implemented completely **from scratch** using **Python + NumPy** — **no scikit-learn models for training**, only for final benchmarking and comparison.

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

Build, train, and visualize core ML algorithms step by step to deeply understand the **math**, **logic**, and **intuition** behind each method.

## 📂 **Folder Structure**

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 📁 **Regression/** | Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial Regression |
| 📁 **Classification/** | Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Perceptron |
| 📁 **Clustering/** | K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering |
| 📁 **Dimensionality Reduction/** | PCA, LDA |
| 📁 **Ensembles/** | Adaboost, Random Forest |
| 📁 **Neural Networks/** | Simple Neural Network (1 hidden layer) |

Each folder has:
-  Fully documented Jupyter Notebooks
-  Step-by-step math & logic
-  Visualizations (cost curves, boundaries, dendrograms, projections)
-  Benchmark comparison with scikit-learn (where relevant)

## ⚙️ **Core Concepts Covered**

- **Regression:** Predict continuous outcomes (house prices, fuel efficiency)
- **Classification:** Predict discrete classes (spam detection, flower species)
- **Clustering:** Find groups in unlabeled data
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Project data to lower dimensions (PCA, LDA)
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple learners for stronger predictions
- **Neural Networks:** Basics of deep learning with forward/backward propagation

---

## 📊 **Datasets**

Each notebook uses simple, well-known datasets:
- **California Housing**
- **Iris**
- **Titanic**
- **Auto MPG**
- Toy or synthetic datasets for clear visuals
